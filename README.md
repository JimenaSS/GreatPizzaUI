# GreatPizzaUI project

This UI project was implemented using Angular Cli v 7.3.10 due to local environment npm installed. 
To give some styles to the view, bulma framework was added. To re-use existing components, angular material was added to the project. Http is being used for the communication with GreatPizza web api services and errors are being handled using an error handler service. Communication functionality was absracted into a pizza service which is the responsible of handling the connection to the api.

### Desirable implementations:
⋅⋅* With more time and planification, unit tests must be better developed.
⋅⋅* Documentation is missing.
⋅⋅* A POST, PUT and DELETE process is missing to demonstrate a full CRUD communication with GreatPizza api.
